# MobilePhoneContactList
Simple contact list(with a few bugs..)

The program adds contacts consisting of a name and a number and stores them in 2 seperate array lists, but keeps track by the index the were created at. (Since both a number and a name will have been made at the same time, each array' index will have store it's own data about the same contact. I realize this may not be the most effective way but i thought it would be a great experiment to expand my knowledge at the time).
